<h2>Hello !</h2>
</br>
This is our Final EPITECH Graphical Programming Project.</br>
</br>
The goal is to create a RPG Game in C, with the CSFML Library.</br>
So, we create this game with a City theme, and the main character is an hacker.</br>
</br>
For the moment, in our game, you can do 4 mission.</br>
The fight system is oriented in Hacking.</br>
</br>

So if you want to try, just do : </br>
```make``` of ```make re``` for compile all source files </br>
</br>

After just launch the binary like : </br>
```./my_rpg``` </br>
</br>
Now enjoy !</br>
</br>
</br>
PS: It will maybe have some update because we will continue to update our game</br>
